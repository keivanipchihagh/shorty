Make your URLs shorter in Go

* [Endpoints](#Endpoints)
* [System Design](#system-design)

## Endpoints
| **Path** | **Method** | **Cache** | **Description** 
| --- | --- | -- | -- |
| `/:shortened` | GET | Yes | Redirects to the original URL
| `/urls` | POST | No | Creates a new URL
| `/urls` | GET | No | Returns all URLs available
| `/urls:id` | GET | No | Returns a specific URL by ID
| `/metrics` | GET | No | Returns Prometheus metrics

## System Design

### Hash + Collision Resolution

[Hashing]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function)) is an easy solution to implement, but it doesn't guarantee unique URLs and the collisions must be solved. In case of a collision, a [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)) is added the the hash and the process is repeated until the collision is resolved.

Pros:
- Has a fixed URL length
- Doesn't need a unique ID generator

Cons:
- Solving collision can become costly

### Snowflake + Base62
Base62 is another approach that requires a unique ID generator to be implemented. To implement the Key Generation Service (KGS), I use [Twitter's Snowflake](https://github.com/twitter-archive/snowflake) algorithm to ensure unique ID generation.

Pros:
- Easily scalable
- Collision is almost impossible

Cons:
- Requires a unique ID generator
- Length is not fixed and grows with IDs
