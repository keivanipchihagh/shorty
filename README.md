## Endpoints
| **Path** | **Method** | **Cache** | **Description** 
| --- | --- | -- | -- |
| `/:shortened` | GET | Yes | Redirects to the original URL
| `/urls` | POST | No | Creates a new shortened URL
| `/urls` | GET | No | Returns all URLs available
| `/urls:id` | GET | No | Returns a specific URL by ID
| `/metrics` | GET | No | 	Exposes Prometheus metrics

## System Design

### Hash + Collision Resolution

[Hashing]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function)) is a simple and effective method for URL shortening, but it does not guarantee uniqueness. When a collision occurs, we resolve it by adding a [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)) to the hash and rehashing until the collision is resolved.

Pros:
- Fixed URL length
- No need for a unique ID generator

Cons:
- Handling collisions can become resource-intensive
- The process of rehashing can be costly

### Snowflake + Base62

An alternative approach is using Base62 encoding in combination with a unique ID generation system, such as [Twitter's Snowflake](https://github.com/twitter-archive/snowflake) algorithm. This method ensures uniqueness by generating time-based, globally unique IDs.

Pros:
- Easily scalable
- Collision is almost impossible

Cons:
- Requires a unique ID generator
- URL length is not fixed and can increase as IDs grow
